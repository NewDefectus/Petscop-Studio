—signs along the way, that I ignored. 'Cause it would've been a completely ridiculous idea to me. But when I found my room, it made... well, I was shocked at first, but it made sense. Especially considering where I found the game in the first place, that it would be tied in some way to me through you. And I'm trying to think, when was the last time I saw any of you at all? It had to have been, like, 1999. I was a kid, I was a small kid. Tiny kid. And after that, just, you know. But, it would make sense in the timeline.
So, it's hard to do this while I'm talking, that's why I'm so quiet right now.
So, if you're wondering what I'm doing right now, I have a drawing that I could scan and send to you. I just came home and drew this big drawing. And it's still... you still need an explanation on... 'cause the drawing is not very clear—scribbles really—but... but you need the visual to understand the explanation, right? So you need both.
I'm about 90% sure that this is gonna work, and 10% not so sure. But mostly sure. Wait, wait, I think I did that wrong. So, again, wait.
Holy shit. Holy shit. It worked. I mean, I was 90% sure, but... heh. It's still a little shocking that it actually worked. That's very neat. Alright, so the way this works, I'm supposed to pass on this one.
He-heh! There it is. OK.
K. So, this one we wanna... What do we wanna... we wanna ask about the house. We wanna ask "where"... just, "where is house?"
K. OK. So, I don't know... I mean, it's probably asking to go this way, right? Yeah, I think that's what's happening.
That's not what I was expecting, actually. I guess that a road makes sense, but it's not visually the same thing that I was expecting to see. See what the camera just did there.
"This is a frozen house"... I think we found the house. I don't know what that... We just found the fucking house.
We found the house.
“The key still”... What? What? "you"... "you can't open it".
—nother joke about how I can't open doors.
—clockwise, the top is going to the right, and then, you know, the bottom is going to the left. Right, so what you wanna say is "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey", or, you know, you turn this... turn this thing to the... to the right. I mean, I still get confused about that. 'Cause, I mean, well, I know it's always the top, but I still have to think. I have to think.
Well, we have the door open now, so, I mean... heh. OK.
Alright. OK.
This is interesting. We got people, appearing and disappearing.
Uh...
Got a couple of calendars here.
Hm.
So...
These are different years.
So we got this green here. It starts off like a checkerboard, then whatever this is, and then weekends, then it's green every day.
Oh. OK. I dunno if you got that immediately. Yeah, so, June to November. Mhm. Yeah, on that topic: I don't remember meeting this girl at all. I don't remember knowing her at any point. And I remember you saying that we were... that we... we are... exactly the same age. Right? I-I-I-I just don't remember even hearing about anyone going missing. Right? I don't have a single... I don't remember her going missing. I don't remember anything like that. I mean, I was a kid, but even then... Could've been one of those periods when we weren't visiting very much, but it just seems weird. Right, 'cause, I don't know if you can verify these dates, but 5th of June, 10th of November, right? When she went missing and when she was found. Right?
And the 25th here... I'm wondering what the... what the animation means there. Or how the number is animating a bit. Because... right? The 25th of December on... both calendars, but they're different years. So I don't know if it... means it's the 25th of December in this house, but then it's two different years, so that's...
I do agree there's a resemblance. Very strong resemblance... between us.
Woah.
What?
The hell? Heh. That was an experience. This... huh.
What?
The hell? Heh. That was an experience. This... huh.
Hey. I could've sworn I just saw, above the bathtub... those white blocks with the symbols on them. We were seeing some of those before. I could've sworn I just saw one of those right... right there. Um... yeah, um... everything's different now. Tree is gone; we got a bucket here. And... that looks the same.
Hm.
It's the 5th. I don't know if we can find out the in-game time, and... what the hell is this?
Another Care. Can I get on this bed? Think I'm supposed to get up on the bed. Hmm... Don't know how this is supposed to work.
Yeah, I dunno. I don't know what we can do here. Um, but... I do wanna see something.
Well, we're free now. That's good. I'm interested in this window. I don't really know what to do, but... if we could... come in through the window, I don't know if that's a thing.
Oh. Hm?
Yeah. I don't know, is there something I missed in here? I don't think so.
Heh! That's a... that's a fun thing, fun thing that just happened, heh. I didn't do that. I can't close doors. I can't open doors, either, so I... I also can't... uh, yeah. That's fun. I dunno what... I mean, I fucking... I know what it wants me to do now. Yeah...
M...wh...what?
Uh-oh.
“Care left the room.”
Oh. Just gonna... put everything back where it was. I still can't... Wait, so... So, if I—oh, shit. Uh, wh... heh. Shit. Where'd he just come from? Bathroom? I was gonna... 'Cause he came from the window, as I was saying. Yeah. Yeah, now there's a cute little ladder there.
Ta-da. Well, that's that. Unless I can look at the... Pets now.
Rainer... I saw him at a birthday party once. All the older kids were down in the basement playing video games, to hide from everyone. He was down there too. He was older than the rest of them, though.
It said, "Check your bathroom". I don't know.
