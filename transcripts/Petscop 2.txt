Hey, so, the door opened on its own. I was just in the other room for a couple of minutes, and I came back and the door was open. And I checked the recording, 'cause I was recording, and the door just opens on its own; I didn't do anything.
So, I'll take it, right? So I'm gonna show you what's in here now. I haven't seen it yet, so, this could be interesting.
Huh.
Is that a phone?
What is this?
A, B, NLM. Uh... K. Nothin'.
This just keeps goin'. Uh, yeah. K.
Hm. Sorry for not talking very much. I'm a little bewildered if you wanna know the truth. This is a little more than I was expecting to see.
That's a dead kid. Yep. Yep. K.
Wait. OK.
K. Uh, wait. I dunno.
So, when I first came down here I thought I was just gonna see, like, one room. Like something, but not this. Can I go in here? I can!
Oh.
What?
I don't know... ok.
Uh... uh... heh.
Oh.
Alright, so it's been like two minutes. And when those sounds were playing, there was nothing happening as far as I could tell, and nothing has happened since. So, I'm just gonna keep going. There's already been stuff that I could dig a little deeper into, and I'm gonna do that, and keep you updated. But also, when you come home next month, and hopefully you're feeling a little more enthusiastic about that now, we can investigate this together, and maybe you'll find stuff that I can't find here.
Oh.
What the fuck? Wait a second. What was that just now? Can I get that to happen again? Wait... uh...
Hey, sorry, I had to look at that for a moment, in the video. I was a little nervous. The tones, I think those were the same tones that you might have heard in the beginning. I'm gonna put in the beginning the part where the door opened. And, also, the way the guy on the other side was moving, for a moment: I'm gonna ask for your comment later on that. So, I was looking around here. So, this... is backwards, it says, "Do you remember being born?" And, this just says, "Quitter's Room". So, interestingly I'm on the reverse side here. Uh, yeah. OK, so, moving on.
Mm. And I'm back up here again. This again. Well, OK, I'm not gonna do that right now. Alright, so I'm gonna stop this now actually.
