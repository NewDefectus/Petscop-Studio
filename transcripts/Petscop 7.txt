Something's happening.
Oh, hi there. Is that... it? That might be it. Except, what is...
Uh... oh-kay.
Hm. So, we might know who Marvin is now. Oh, I need to be quick about this, actually. 'Cause it could turn red again. So, I'm gonna ask "Who are you?" Which, I feel like we know at this point, but good to confirm.
It's talking about the house again. It's interesting, but it is not an answer to my question. Heh, not at all. So, what do you think that means? OK, I should... So, yeah, so now I'm gonna ask the other question, the "Do you remember being born?"... oh, yeah, it's just "Remember being born?", 'cause the whole thing does not fit.
"MACHINE BEYOND SCHOOL BASEMENT STAIRWAY"... not... also not an answer to my... question. Yeah, and it... yeah, well.
Heh, well there you go. "Child Library accepts people." OK, well I guess I'm kind of an idiot. I wouldn't have tried that. I guess these... these are people, right? Those might work. Yeah. So, if I walk over here... Yeah, it's just normal.
OK, so that's another thing.
Anything out of the ordinary here? What's on the floor? Looks like a gift box, and stars, and something else. And anything down here? As usual, no.
So, this... If you're wondering what I'm doing here, this is Mike's face, but without the eyebrows. And why am I doing that? Well, because eyebrows seem to be important. And that's really it. But nothing seems to have actually... this seems like it's just reg— one— just, regular room, right? Yeah, OK. I dunno. Guess that's it. Alright, I have one more thing to try though.
This one is Care with eyebrows.
So, this is Care with eyebrows. I put Mike's eyebrows on her. I could have put other eyebrows on her, but I didn't. I put Mike's on her.
I don't know if this... I— I can't tell... I can't tell if it recognized it or not, because everything looks... like any other room. What's this here? Except, it puts... this... I don't know, maybe that's just something that it puts in any room.
