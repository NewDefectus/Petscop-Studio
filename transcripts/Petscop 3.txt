Alright, so now we're gonna look at what's over here, which I... I forgot about this. So, gonna look at this now.
Interesting.
What's that? Do I...
Think I have to put something there.
What? Um... oh? K. Heh, what? OK.
This is just flat out a full game that I'm playing now. What am I supposed to do? Can I just walk out?
I don't think I was supposed to do that. Yeah. Uh... yeah, I reset it. OK, try that again.
So, do I just wait? I think that's what I'm supposed to do. Or, I have to put something in there.
Yeah, turns out I just had to wait, but I had to wait a while. So, this is cleared out I guess. So, what's in here?
Uh... OK. Well, alright. Let's try another one, I guess.
So, I just did it again, I put in another one of these, and I just let it go. And, the room rumbles for a while, but then it just stops, kind of abruptly. So, what do we have here now? Yeah.
So, yeah, so it seems like I put in one of these faces and it gives me a room, with a... I guess that's a kid, sitting on the bed. And, like, a different pattern on the floor and the walls, and the thing here.
So, it seems like there are many combinations of these faces. So, if I were to guess, these rooms are, 'cause there's not that much variation between these rooms, they're probably generated in some way. So, I'll try a few more. Every time I put in one of these, I have to wait for like ten minutes, so, heh, I'm not gonna try too many of them. I'm gonna... yeah.
Here's another one.
And here's another.
Yeah.
So, anything look familiar here? Yeah. Yeah, so, probably we're supposed to try these out; put in these faces, and see what we get. So, I'll start with this one.
So, this is the room corresponding to the face on the gravestone. Not sure what that is on the right. Alright, gonna try the other one now, I guess. Nothin'... nothin' to see here. The bed's empty.
Here's the other room. And it looks like there's something here.
What am I reading?
I'm not sure what to say about that. But, I'm wondering now. 'Cause the note, remember the note, that came with this game: it said "For you." It was... for "you." And this note, it's referring to the player, it's saying "you." And, I was already thinking this, but it seems like... it's possible this game was made for... well, this part of the game was made for somebody to see. Like... or at least, at some point, it was... it was, uh... I dunno. I dunno. It just seems like there was... it was intended for somebody. Not me, certainly. Uh... OK.
We're still not done, 'cause we still have whatever's over here. Or not. OK. So, OK. I'll just end this here, then. Heh.
