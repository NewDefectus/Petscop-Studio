Alright, so, I spent a while with this. Just asking as many questions as I could think of. Mostly, like, short, three-word things. And most of the questions that I asked just produced no answer, or the default answer. The default answer, which is "I don't know". Most of them just gave me that, except for four of them. And I'm gonna go through each of those four now.
The first of the four was, "Who is Tiara?" And capitalization does not make a difference. But, “Who is Tiara?” I also tried "Who is Care?", "Who is Mike?", "Who is Michael", and I tried other forms too, like just "Care?", just "Mike?", just "Michael?" This is the only one that gave me anything.
Uh, next one that I tried, I think... uh, yeah.
Next, I asked "Where am I?"
And then I asked "Who are you?" Uh... I don't know why that just happened. Yeah, so I was saying... "Who are you?", yeah. I don't know why that just changed color out of nowhere.
I think it broke. Y-yeah, I don't think that even just-just registered at all. Or, uh...
K. So, that's not... that's not what it said before when I put in that question. Did not look anything like that. That's interesting. Heh...
OK... uh, what... what do I ask now? "Why"... "Why turn off"... I'll try just, "Why?"
K. Oh, boy. Mm. Yeah, I don't...
What the fuck. Uh... This fucking game. Heh. This game... OK, um... Alright, what do I... what do I have to ask now? Um, wh- And it switched back again. I think it just... OK. I don't... heh. So, if I—if I put in, what was it, if I put in "Who are you?" again, is that gonna... Lemme see what happens when I put that in again.
Yeah, so that's what it said originally, when I put it in. Oh, well, OK, that's bizarre. So, I guess, I'm gonna wait for that to happen again. But I guess I'm gonna end the video now, though.
