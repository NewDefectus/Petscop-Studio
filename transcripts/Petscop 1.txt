Alright, so, this is just to prove to you that I'm not lying about this game that I found. I'm just gonna walk you through everything that I've seen so far. And obviously it'll be exactly as I described it because this is it.
And the first level is over here. I'm just gonna keep going a bit here so you can see that the game is apparently unfinished, because there's nothing over here. So, I'm just gonna show you the one and only level. This actually is not the interesting part, but I'm just gonna show you; I'm gonna walk you through all this so you can see that this is exactly what I described.
So, the first pet is in this room. And, first thing you gotta do here is let her out of her cage, and she just moves to the other one. And then you do that; take the money here. And then, actually, you go over here, and she just does that, but if you do this: if you lock yourself in here, then he just... Amber will just run over there. So, once you're in here, actually, you can find a little place here to walk to the other side. So that's that.
And, so, there's actually, there's another pet over here, and I can't catch this one. I've tried. This is always what happens. So, I don't know what's up with that one.
So, actually, I should show you the pause menu. So, here you can see all the pets that you've collected; that you've caught.
Alright, so the second one here is sort of a music one. The idea here is you have to get your clone over there to overlap with it. And I'll just cut to the chase: you just set this to... what is it? Seven. And, just like that. I don't totally get that one, but that's that.
Alright, so this one's kind of interesting. So, the idea is, if you run over here to catch the flower here, then you'll just get rained on. What you're supposed to do is: whenever the flower comes over here, you notice, always comes to that exact spot over there, which you can get this bucket... to that exact spot. Is that the spot? Yeah. And then the... then that happens and you can just catch them both that way.
OK. So, yeah, that's it for the... actually that's everything. That's every single pet here, that I've been able to catch. So, now I'm gonna show you the part that's actually interesting.
Alright, so I still can't catch this guy. The reason we're here is because in the note that came with this, which is short, the first line, in all capital letters... I'm gonna read it, it says: "I WALKED DOWNSTAIRS AND WHEN I GOT TO THE BOTTOM, INSTEAD OF PROCEEDING, I TURNED THE RIGHT AND BECAME A SHADOW MONSTER MAN." Below that, a date: June 13th, 1997. "For you," colon, "Please go to my website on the sticker and also go to roneth's room and press start and press down down down down down right start." So I happen to know this is Roneth's room, because it works. So, I go here. I'm just gonna do this now. So... what is it? Down, down, down, down, down, right, start.
Alright. So, you can see that it accepted it, and the music stopped. I'm just gonna go out this way here. So, it appears to be the same, except, when I actually leave here, it'll be a little bit different.
Alright. So there's nothing out here, as far as I've seen. But, actually, I think there is something out here. I just haven't seen it yet. Because... it sure seems like... in this note here it sure seems like, right, I'm supposed to come out here and look at something. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm thinking if I just keep walking around here, I'm gonna find something eventually. I st—I—
Hey, so, I was talking about how I couldn't find anything out here. Well, I just found this. And, last time I came out here, I was walking around in this space, here, for over an hour. And this time I find this in less than fifteen minutes. So, this is just luck that I happened to find this. And, I think, if I were to restart my console right now, I would not be able to find this again. Probably. 'Cause I don't remember what I... what I did. You know, all the directions that I went. So... so, I'm kinda scared to... you know, I wanna keep the console on until I figure this out. The situation is that I cannot open this door. I probably can open the door, but I don't know what to do. So, I thought I would just slip this in at the end. If you think you saw something that might provide a clue, please, let me know. Alright, that's it.
