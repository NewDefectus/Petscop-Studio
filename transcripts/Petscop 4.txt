So, if you remember what I was trying to explain yesterday, and failed to explain, I'm just gonna demonstrate that to you now.
There we go. So I found this yesterday. And the way I understand this is, so, we're upstairs right now. You just saw me walk up some stairs. So, if you were to imagine what is... what would be exactly below where I'm standing right now. And I worked it out, it's roughly the area where you have the big screen, with the windmill. And, so I think... so, this, I think, is a camera. And if I walk in this direction... This is, roughly, where the windmill would be. Why there isn't actually a windmill here, I don't know. It looks sort of like a placeholder for it. But yeah, I think my understanding is correct. It's just, I'm missing something. OK, that's it.
